A double-ended queue (deque) is a data structure that supports insertion 
and deletion of elements from both the front and the back. Here's a list 
of commonly used functions for a deque implementation along with their purposes:

    pushFront(val): Insert an element at the front of the deque.

    pushBack(val): Insert an element at the back of the deque.

    popFront(): Remove and return the element from the front of the deque.

    popBack(): Remove and return the element from the back of the deque.

    front(): Return a reference to the element at the front of the deque without removing it.

    back(): Return a reference to the element at the back of the deque without removing it.

    empty(): Check if the deque is empty.

    size(): Return the number of elements in the deque.

    clear(): Remove all elements from the deque.

    at(index): Access the element at the specified index with bounds checking.

    insert(index, val): Insert an element at the specified index.

    erase(index): Remove the element at the specified index.

These functions provide basic operations for manipulating elements in a double-ended queue. 
You may choose to implement additional functions based on specific requirements or optimizations. 
Additionally, you'll need to decide on the underlying data structure to use for the implementation, 
such as an array-based or linked list-based approach.
